On my visual studio code did not see the ".JSX" extenxions file.

###To get a quickly fix for that you can try this:

###Go to ###settings.jsx

###Then #copy  &   #paste  the code from the file in this folder

###or

###If you want you can just replace the file in you .vscode/config
###Keep in mind if you replace your original files you may ***LOSE ALL YOUR SETUP!***
